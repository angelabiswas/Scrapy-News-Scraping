The Italian firm had been selling cookies and chocolate-covered biscuits under the mark \" Amuleti ,\" which closely resembled Amul 's well-known trademark. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, which markets dairy products under brand name Amul, filed the suit through counsel Abhishek Singh, who argued that Amul, a household name in India, had a global reputation, ranking 8th among the world's top dairy organisations. Singh contended that Terre Primitive had \"blatantly\" copied the script, style, and manner in which \"Amul\" was represented simply by adding the word \"eti\" to the mark. Justice Mini Pushkarna passed the injunction order restraining the Italian firm from using or dealing with any marks identical to \"Amul\" and directed them to remove infringing products from their website. Meta Inc. was ordered to block or delete the Italian firm's social media accounts promoting the said products. Jayen Mehta, the managing director of Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, called the order a relief for Amul and a precedent for protecting indigenous brands from foreign infringement. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

Most investors in India were unaware of Zettai before the cyberattack that drove the company to Singapore court to seek a moratorium. It emerged that Zettai is the parent of the Indian company Zanmai which launched the WazirX platform. However, the two investors - Bitcipher Labs and NextGenDev - have asserted that their \"legal relationships are with Zanmai and not Zettai\". In a letter to the Singapore court, CHP Law , a firm representing these investors, said, \"Our clients are uncertain from their reading of NS1A why Zettai SG considers them to be creditors of Zettai SG. Zettai SG has also not communicated with them about this.\" Artificial Intelligence Java Programming with ChatGPT: Learn using Generative AI By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead Instructor View Program Artificial Intelligence Basics of Generative AI : Unveiling Tomorrow's Innovations By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead Instructor View Program Artificial Intelligence Generative AI for Dynamic Java Web Applications with ChatGPT By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead Instructor View Program Artificial Intelligence Mastering C++ Fundamentals with Generative AI: A Hands-On By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead Instructor View Program Artificial Intelligence Master in Python Language Quickly Using the ChatGPT Open AI By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead Instructor View Program Office Productivity Zero to Hero in Microsoft Excel: Complete Excel guide 2024 By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead Instructor View Program Astrology Vastu Shastra Course By - Sachenkumar Rai, Vastu Shashtri View Program Data Science SQL for Data Science along with Data Analytics and Data Visualization By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead Instructor View Program Web Development A Comprehensive ASP.NET Core MVC 6 Project Guide for 2024 By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead Instructor View Program Office Productivity Mastering Microsoft Office: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and 365 By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead Instructor View Program Marketing Digital marketing - Wordpress Website Development By - Shraddha Somani, Digital Marketing Trainer, Consultant, Strategiest and Subject Matter expert View Program Web Development Mastering Full Stack Development: From Frontend to Backend Excellence By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead Instructor View Program Finance Financial Literacy - TDS, Budget, Income Tax Act, GST, Indirect tax By - CA Rahul Gupta, CA with 10+ years of domain experience, trainer View Program Leadership Business Storytelling Masterclass By - Ameen Haque, Founder of Storywallahs View Program Future of Marketing & Branding Masterclass By - Dr. David Aaker, Professor at Haas School of Business View Program HR & People Management Human Potential and the Future of Employment By - Lynda Gratton, Co-chair of the World Economic Forum Council on Work, Wages and Job Creation, Professor of Management Practice View Program Strategy ESG and Business Sustainability Strategy By - Vipul Arora, Partner, ESG & Climate Solutions at Sattva Consulting Author I Speaker I Thought Leader View Program Finance Financial Reporting and Analytics By - Dr. C.P. Gupta, Professor: Department of Finance and Business Economics, University of Delhi View Program Marketing Performance Marketing for eCommerce Brands By - Zafer Mukeri, Founder- Inara Marketers View Program According to the affidavit, Zettai took control, \"under protest\", of the cryptocurrency tokens from its partner Binance following a rift between the two. The dispute is currently in the midst of arbitration proceedings in Singapore whose deliberations are confidential. In the letter before the court, CHP, on behalf of Bitcipher and NextGenDev, said that no documents have been disclosed to show how the transfer of control and/or ownership of the tokens between the parties occurred. \"Further, it is not clear which is the specific entity/person who is presently holding the tokens belonging to WazirX's users, in particular, the specific tokens belonging to our clients. Clarity needs to be provided as to which tokens Binance, Zettai SG and Zanmai India respectively hold and/or control,\" they said. The letter, outlining the objections of the two investors, was attached to a supplementary affidavit filed by Shetty on September 10. The first affidavit was filed in end-August. With multiple offshore crypto platforms approaching Indian authorities to do business here, the WazirX development is being closely tracked by some of the practitioners of tax and foreign exchange laws. According to Harshal Bhuta, partner at the CA firm PR Bhuta & Co, the recent revelation that Zanmai India did not actually hold custody of cryptocurrencies complicates matters for Indian users of the platform. \"As a consequence, if it is construed that users' cryptocurrencies are held in custody wallets outside India, then it may expose the Indian users to complications under the Foreign Exchange Management Act , where there is uncertainty regarding the regulations for purchase of cryptocurrencies held outside India. Additionally, Indian users may need to report these cryptocurrencies as foreign assets in their tax returns under Schedule FA, failing which they may face penalties under Black Money law,\" said Bhuta. It appears that Zanmai India operated rupee-related services on the platform, while Binance operated the rest. Referring to this, the letter said, \"It is not clear what the term 'operating' means. No documents have been disclosed to elaborate on what this means. In particular, our clients are interested to know if 'operating' means that Zanmai India held and/or controlled all tokens belonging to INR-related matters, including all transactions involving our clients.\" A cyberattack in July 2024 saw one of the platform's wallets emptied of $234 million in funds. But it is unclear which specific wallet was emptied and which of WazirX's users' funds were held in that wallet, said the two platform users. And more importantly, whether their tokens were held in the hacked wallet. These investors have also questioned the jurisdiction of the Singapore court in a dispute between them and Zanmai. Such questions thrown up in the wake of the WazirX fiasco have once again underscored the ambiguities around cryptocurrency transactions in India. While there is no legal ban on crypto trades and all deals and gains are heavily taxed, local users may still be clueless about how and where the virtual digital assets they have been betting on are housed and whether they have unwittingly broken any law. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

The report was followed by the Congress making several allegations against her over weeks. Today, Hindenburg wrote on X, \"Buch has maintained her complete silence for weeks on all of the emerging issues.\" Right after Hindenburg published its report targeting her and her husband, they released a statement clarifying the allegations. But since then, she has observed complete silence, though the private companies that figured in the allegations against her have issued clarifications.

Nearly a week ago, ET had reported based on information from sources that the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee was set to look into allegations against the Sebi chief and may summon her later this month. The matter was added to the PAC's agenda after several members demanded an inquiry into the functioning of Sebi and allegations against Buch at the panel's first meeting on August 29, ET reported. The PAC is headed by Congress leader KC Venugopal and has members from both the ruling NDA and the opposition INDIA bloc.

Gupta, Professor: Department of Finance and Business Economics, University of Delhi View Program Marketing Performance Marketing for eCommerce Brands By - Zafer Mukeri, Founder- Inara Marketers View Program However, it seems the probe by PAC is still not a settled issue. It has become a bone of contention between the MPs of ruling and opposition side in the panel, ET reported yesterday. Also Read: Madhabi Buch maintained complete silence for weeks: Hindenburg TMC Sougata Roy demanded that Buch should depose before the PAC to discuss the functioning of SEBI, as per ET's source-based report. Roy made this demand at a meeting convened to take up the performance audit of Jal Jeevan Mission. The TMC also wrote a letter to PAC Chairperson KC Venugopal requesting to call SEBI chairperson as it is a matter of public interest, sources told ET. BJP leader Nishikant Dubey, strongly objected to the demand saying it was against rules. Dubey also added that CAG principal auditor cannot audit Sebi without the mandate of the central government, hence the PAC too cannot summon officials of regulators without evidence of \"flaws\" in finances provided by the government. Dubey is learnt to have said that the PAC being the oldest parliamentary panel has its sets of defined rules and if a suo motu cognisance has to be taken, it has to be substantiated with evidence. In the absence of a formal probe so far, Madhabi Puri Buch's silence on mounting allegations against her is making her situation more untenable. Her silence is likely to only embolden her detractors and give weight to the allegations. How Buch landed into a whirlpool of trouble Ever since Hindenburg published a report accusing Madhabi Puri Buch of conflict of interest nearly a month ago, allegations have been coming thick and fast against her. By now, there are complaints against the IIM-Ahmedabad alumnus from four different quarters - international , domestic , internal as well as political . As soon as the controversy surrounding fresh claims by Hindenburg died down following detailed clarifications by all parties, Congress jumped in. Party spokesperson Pawan Khera alleged that Buch continued to draw a salary from ICICI Bank while she was a member of SEBI, which, according to him, represents a serious breach of ethics and accountability in public service. While this time neither Sebi nor Buch issued any official statement, ICICI Bank made it clear that she wasn't paid any salary or ESOPs after superannuation in October 2013, other than retiral benefits. Soon after, Zee group patriarch Subhash Chandra levelled several allegations against the Sebi chief and even called her \"corrupt\". \"This was the main reason for the merger to set apart, and that is why I am questioning today that Sebi is supposed to protect the interest of minority shareholders, and she succeeded in pushing away Sony from getting merged with Zee,\" he alleged. Bush also faced allegations from her own employees. It came to light recently that Sebi officials made an unprecedented complaint to the finance ministry last month, accusing her of fostering a toxic work culture. \"Shouting, scolding and public humiliation have become a norm in meetings,\" said the August 6 letter, which ET had reviewed. Hundreds of Sebi officers protested last week at the headquarters of the capital markets regulator in Mumbai, demanding the resignation of Buch while also seeking withdrawal of Sebi's media statement that described their letter to the Centre as a likely fallout of instigation by unidentified ‘external elements’. Sebi said employees, who were demanding a 55% hike in HRA, twisted the narrative to make it a \"work culture\" issue after their earlier protest yielded no result. The Congress did not stop at accusing Buch of receiving payments from ICICI Bank. Congress spokesperson Khera alleged that Buch and her husband own a property in Mumbai, which was given on rent to a company called Carol Info Services Ltd, and is a part of Wockhardt Ltd. , a firm that has been investigated by Sebi for multiple cases. However, Wockhardt denied conflict of interest and corruption allegations made by the Congress. Yesterday, the Congress in a \"shocking\" set of \"revelations\" alleged that Buch and her husband earned crores of rupees from six listed companies including Mahindra and Mahindra . Congress said that contrary to her claim that an advisory company owned by her became dormant when she took office, Agora Private Limited continued to provide services and generated revenue of Rs 2.95 crore between 2016-2024. The Congress claimed that Agora clients include Mahindra and Mahindra Limited, Dr. Reddy’s, Pidilite , ICICI, Sembcorp, Visu Leasing & Finance. \"Strangely, of the total Rs 2.95 Crores received by Agora Advisory Private Limited, 2.59 Crores has come from one entity alone - the Mahindra & Mahindra Group. It accounts for 88 per cent of the total money that Agora Advisory received,\" it alleged. However, Mahindra called allegations levied by Congress against the auto major and the Sebi chief \"false and misleading in nature\". It said the allegations suggest a conflict of interest on payments made to Dhaval Buch, husband of Madhabi Buch. Mahidnra clarified that Dhaval Buch was hired in 2019 specifically for his expertise in supply chain and sourcing, soon after he retired as Unilever's Global Chief Procurement Officer. He has spent most of his time at Bristlecone, a subsidiary which is a supply chain consulting company and is currently on the Board of Bristlecone. He joined Mahindra Group almost three years before Madhabi Puri Buch was appointed as SEBI Chairperson, the company clarified. Compensation has been specifically and only for Buch’s supply chain expertise and management acumen, based on his global experience at Unilever, the company said. Dr Reddy's Laboratories too issued a clarification on the allegations levelled by the Congress, terming them \"baseless and malafide\", saying that Dhaval Buch's assignment with the company \"started and ended well before Ms Madhabi Buch’s term as SEBI Chairperson\". Should Buch speak or not? Though the allegations have been denied by involved companies, Buch's silence on the allegations only gives strength to her detractors. However, her response to each and every allegations might drag her deeper into the mess. Industrialist Harsh Goenka, who came out in Buch's support last week, said she may have made some enemies because of not being diplomatic enough. \"It's disheartening to see Madhabi Puri Buch, head of SEBI, being cornered despite her strong moral values and integrity. Diplomacy may not be her strength, and it seems she's made some enemies because of it. However, I'm confident she'll rise above it all and come out stronger,\" Goenka had written on X. An undergraduate in mathematics from Delhi's St. Stephens College, Buch held various roles at ICICI Bank and was also the CEO of ICICI Securities from 2009 to 2011. After joining the watchdog as its whole-time member from 2017 to 2021, she was appointed as the Chairperson in March 2022. Her 3-year-term ends in March 2025. A group of the Sebi chief's IIM Ahmedabad classmates have banded together to support her. A letter being circulated on social media aims to clear allegations against Buch. “What is happening today in the public space in terms of mud-slinging against a senior functionary of a democratic institution of the country, is unfortunate. If we, with just a little bit of effort on fact check could determine all of this, is it not sad that even this much effort is not being taken before sullying a person's reputation? We are continuing our fact-checks on other questions that have been raised and will share our findings with you as we get them,\" it said. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

They also clarified that they are not involved in any Swiss court proceedings, emphasizing that neither their group companies were mentioned in any such court documents nor have they received any requests for clarification. A Swiss twist in the Adani-Hindenburg saga In a post on X on Thursday, the US short-seller said that the probe, which dates back to 2021, has shed light on financial practices involving opaque offshore entities tied to the Indian conglomerate. Swiss criminal court records show in detail how an Adani frontman invested in opaque BVI/Mauritius & Bermuda funds that almost exclusively owned Adani stock, the U.S.-based short seller said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, citing a Swiss media outlet. — HindenburgRes As per a report by Swiss media, Geneva Public Prosecutor's Office was investigating alleged wrongdoing by the Indian conglomerate Adani well before activist investors from Hindenburg Research made the first accusations.

Adani Group vehemently rejected the allegations saying, \"We unequivocally reject and deny the baseless allegations presented. The Adani Group has no involvement in any Swiss court proceedings, nor have any of our company accounts been subject to sequestration by any authority.\" It went on to say that \"even in the alleged order, the Swiss court has neither mentioned our group companies, nor have we received any requests for clarification or information from any such authority or regulatory body. We reiterate that our overseas holding structure is transparent, fully disclosed, and compliant with all relevant laws.\" The allegations, it said, \"are clearly preposterous, irrational, and absurd. We have no hesitation in stating that this is yet another orchestrated and egregious attempt by the same cohorts acting in unison to inflict irreversible damage on our group's reputation and market value.\" You Might Also Like: Hindenburg questions SEBI chief's silence on fresh charges \"The Adani Group remains steadfastly committed to transparency and compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements,\" it said, adding it \"strongly condemns\" the allegations.\" Hindenburg-Sebi showdown Hindenburg, which had accused the Adani Group of using tax havens to circumvent local market regulations back in January 2023, recently alleged that the Securities and Exchange Board of India chairperson, Madhabi Buch, might be influencing the slow investigation into the conglomerate due to her past investments and dealings. Both Buch and the Adani Group have denied these recent allegations. Meanwhile, the opposition Congress party has intensified its scrutiny of Buch, accusing her of holding 99 percent of the shares in a company still actively providing advisory and consultancy services, and alleging that her husband, Dhaval Buch, has earned income from companies under her adjudication. You Might Also Like: Madhabi Buch maintained complete silence for weeks: Hindenburg on Congress' allegations against SEBI chief Hindenburg alleged she had a conflict of interest in the Adani matter because of a previous investment in an offshore fund used by the Adani Group. Buch countered saying the investments pre-date her term at SEBI and that all necessary disclosures were made. She termed Hindenburg's allegations as an attempt at \"character assassination\" following the regulator's enforcement action and \"show cause\" notice to the U.S. based shortseller for violating Indian rules. A show cause notice signals an intention to take disciplinary action if satisfactory explanations are not provided. Buch was appointed to the top post at SEBI in March 2022 after spending five years as a whole-time member, the second highest position at the regulator. She completes her three-year term in March next year. The First Hindenburg attack on Adani Hindenburg in its first attack in Jan 24, 2023, said that Adani Group has been involved in extensive stock manipulation and accounting fraud for decades, with an estimated $218 billion involved. The Group's key companies have taken on significant debt, with five out of seven having reported low current ratios, indicating severe liquidity issues. As per the initial allegations, the Adani Group has faced four major government fraud investigations for money laundering, theft, and corruption, totaling about $17 billion. The Hindenburg report claimed that Vinod Adani, Gautam Adani's elder brother, being linked to numerous offshore shell entities in tax havens, including Mauritius and the Caribbean, which are used for stock manipulation and money laundering. As per the first Hindenburg report, evidence suggested that Adani companies have been involved in stock parking and manipulative trading, with offshore entities controlling large portions of Adani stock and affecting market stability. The US-based short seller also claimed that Adani's independent auditor is a small firm with limited capacity, raising questions about the thoroughness and reliability of financial audits. It added, despite ongoing investigations by SEBI, the Indian securities regulator, enforcement actions have been minimal, allowing the Adani Group to continue its alleged fraudulent activities. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

He has spent most of his time at Bristlecone, a subsidiary which is a supply chain consulting company. Mr. Buch is currently on the Board of Bristlecone. He joined Mahindra Group almost 3 years before Madhabi Puri Buch was appointed as SEBI Chairperson. Compensation has been specifically and only for Mr. Buch’s supply chain expertise and management acumen, based on his global experience at Unilever. None of the 5 SEBI orders or approvals referenced in the allegations are relevant. Details are: Three out of the five approvals or orders of SEBI do not pertain to the Company or any of its subsidiaries. One was a fast-track rights issue, which did not require any approval from SEBI. One was an order issued in Mar 2018, well before Dhaval started working with the Mahindra Group.

Also Read: Madhabi Buch maintained complete silence for weeks: Hindenburg Investments weren’t really a problem for her predecessors. They might have dabbled in stocks on their modest civil-servant salaries, but income from wealth was unlikely to have taken up much space in their tax filings. Unlike Buch, they didn’t own a consulting firm or have access to a segregated account in an offshore fund — two of the points in Hindenburg’s Aug. 10 report that questioned her objectivity. These gentlemen had government pensions, but no employee stock options from a regulated entity — an issue the Congress has made much of. It will be a pity if the media glare on Buch prompts New Delhi to revert to reserving top regulatory jobs for retired or retiring civil servants. They covet these plum sinecures. But restricting the field could deprive institutions of talented outsiders who are genuinely interested in public service. Besides, government insiders don’t have a lock on perceptions of probity: Past SEBI chiefs have also attracted criticism, though usually for the directorships they accepted after leaving office. What needs an update is the code of service. With adequate financial controls, it may be possible for the right candidate to avoid being in the limelight for the wrong reason.

A media mogul, who’s being investigated by the market watchdog for allegedly siphoning funds from his company, has joined the melee and accused her of thwarting the sale of his beleaguered business. Some disgruntled officers have complained of a “toxic work culture” under Buch’s leadership. After the regulator denied those allegations in a five-page press release, some 200 employees staged a silent protest in the SEBI’s Mumbai campus last week. Media reports suggest that parliament’s bipartisan public accounts committee could take up a probe into SEBI. However, it’s unclear if the panel will have the authority to question the chair about her personal finances, given the absence of an official document as its reference point. After the Hindenburg report, Buch said that she disclosed all her interests, and followed a strict recusal policy. But the government that gave her the job may have needed to do more. At the minimum, she should have been asked to put her financial assets into a blind trust, where there’s minimal communication between her and the temporary overseer of her wealth. Also Read: Who is behind Hindenburg Research and what is their allegation on Madhabi Puri Buch There is no such rule. The SEBI’s policy on conflict of interest for board members does not ban trading, except on the basis of unpublished price-sensitive information. The organization’s terms of service merely state that the chairman will not have any financial interests that are “likely to affect prejudicially his functions.” To see how a blind trust might have helped operationalize this, consider a specific allegation. The Congress Party has asked Buch to explain how she kept receiving income from ICICI Bank Ltd., her past employer, even after becoming a full-time member of the regulatory body in 2017 and its chair in 2022. Although Buch didn’t reply, ICICI said the income consisted of superannuation benefits following her 2013 retirement from the bank and gains from stock options awarded to her while she was employed. Since Buch had a 10-year-long period in which she could convert the options, the government needed to ask itself what would be appropriate for the top markets regulator: a “qualified” blind trust or a stricter version? In the former, Buch would exercise her options and place her ICICI stock in the trust before joining the SEBI; in the latter, she would also sell the shares and park the proceeds with the manager. Still, even qualified blind trusts have been hard to enforce among lawmakers in Washington. Also Read: Mounting worries for Madhabi Buch: Sebi officials flag ‘toxic’ work culture The Indian Supreme Court had appointed a committee after Hindenburg’s original short-seller report on the Adani Group cratered the conglomerate’s market value and kept it depressed for most of 2023. The panel said it lacked the evidence to return a finding of regulatory failure on the SEBI’s part. I have previously argued that the same experts should be asked to consider Hindenburg’s new report targeting Buch. However, now that the Congress has questioned her relationship with ICICI, the composition will have to change. K.V. Kamath, one of the committee’s six members, was the CEO of the bank for a part of Buch’s career there. Any inquiry must be more than a postmortem. India needs concrete suggestions on how situations of potential conflict can be prevented from arising in the first place. By hurling allegations in dribs and drabs, lawmakers opposed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi might keep this issue alive until parliament reconvenes in late November or early December. Their goal is to paint a picture of institutional decay and rampant crony capitalism under Modi’s decade-long control on power; the current crisis is just a backdrop. Its resolution in a way that will restore the SEBI’s credibility will be a welcome change for the Indian markets. But I’m not holding my breath. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

The finance minister has indicated in her budget speech that the rules and regulations for FDIs and overseas Investments will be simplified to facilitate foreign direct investments, nudge prioritisation, and promote opportunities for using Indian Rupee as a currency for overseas investments. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

Trump’s Tariff Proposal Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has reiterated his commitment to a robust tariff policy. His proposal includes a 10% tariff on all imported goods and a staggering 60% tariff on imports from China. During the debate, Trump claimed that these tariffs would compel other countries to \"pay us back\" and could generate “hundreds of billions of dollars” in revenue, as mentioned in a report by NBC. The pro-business Tax Foundation estimates that Trump's tariffs could potentially raise up to $2.5 trillion over a decade. However, this revenue may only cover a portion of the tax breaks and spending initiatives proposed by Trump.

Gupta, Professor: Department of Finance and Business Economics, University of Delhi View Program Marketing Digital Marketing By - Zafer Mukeri, Founder- Inara Marketers View Program The economic theory behind these tariffs is that they would protect US industries and jobs, but critics argue that they could lead to increased consumer prices and economic uncertainty. Harris’s Approach In contrast, Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has criticized tariffs as a form of “sales tax” that ultimately burdens American households. The Biden administration has already extended some of the tariffs imposed during Trump’s tenure, focusing on goods like steel, aluminum, and technology components. While Harris has not explicitly stated her stance on extending these tariffs, her campaign emphasizes supporting American industries and addressing unfair trade practices, as per the NBC report. Harris’s plan includes tax breaks for middle-class Americans and higher taxes on wealthier individuals to bolster economic growth and reduce the deficit. The goal is to balance revenue generation and economic fairness without disproportionately affecting consumers. Also Read : U.S Elections: Who is Laura Loomer, far-right activist, who is influencing Donald Trump in his campaign Economic Implications of Tariffs Tariffs come with significant trade-offs. While they can protect domestic industries and promote job creation, they often result in higher prices for consumers. For example, the Trump administration’s 2018 tariffs on washing machines led to an increase in prices by up to 10%, despite creating over 2,000 jobs in the U.S. The cost of these jobs was estimated at $815,000 per position, highlighting the complex impact of tariffs. Economists generally agree that tariffs can support domestic industries but can also impose higher costs on the economy. A 2018 interview with trade historian Douglas Irwin emphasized that while tariffs might benefit certain sectors, they can also result in higher costs and reduced overall economic efficiency. Biden’s Tariff Continuation and Broader Economic Effects The Biden administration’s approach to tariffs includes extending those initiated by Trump and introducing new ones. In May, Biden announced tariffs on steel, aluminum, and critical technology components. The rationale behind these tariffs mirrors that of the Trump administration: addressing unfair trade practices and supporting American workers. However, economists warn that tariffs can create significant economic challenges, such as lower purchasing power and increased business uncertainty. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget suggests that Trump’s proposed 60% tariff on Chinese imports could have mixed results, potentially generating substantial revenue but also leading to economic disruption. FAQs When will the US elections be held? The polls will be conducted on November 4, 2024. Will there be another Presidential debate between Trump and Harris? Trump has refused to participate in another debate with Harris after declaring himself the winner of the last debate. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

        "content": "There are strong concerns about the arrival of a recession in the United States, and the Federal Reserve is trying their best to halt it for as long as possible. Reports suggest that they have gone to the extent of planning an interest rate cut of 50 basis points for stopping the impending recession in its tracks. However, there are multiple other market factors in play, which could bring in a recession or an economic downturn, and the upcoming US elections 2024 could also be one of them. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} What could be the effects of a 50 bps rate cut? A 50 bps rate cut could somehow ease the pressure off of US investors, but it may also bring in certain volatility factors into play in the US markets, suggest a few market experts. Some are suggesting that a 25 bps rate cut would suffice for now, and would not trouble the market scenario, amid the ongoing drama surrounding the US Presidential polls 2024, as well as the September troubles of a few renowned stocks, including the likes of Nvidia, Nasdaq 100 , S&P 500 and more. Should you buy or sell as an US investor amid this crisis market scenario? A US investor should consider all market forces in play at this very moment, including the fact that September is not a very good month for most stocks, especially during any election season in the United States. Therefore, some may consider waiting out this volatile period and hold positions until things are on a optimistic trajectory. Meanwhile, others can consider buying certain stocks that ae dipping heavily this September, including S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100. FAQs: Should one buy Nasdaq 100 now? Nasdaq 100 is obviously a very popular stock to purchase, looking at its optimum returns across years, and also with the fact that it is dipping this September, making it the perfect opportunity. Will S&P 500 continue a downward trend in September? The S&P 500, according to market legend, always follows a downward trajectory in the month of September.

As of now, Netflix has not confirmed Uglies 2, leaving the release date for Pretties uncertain. Given the delays in the production of the first film, it’s challenging to predict when the sequel might arrive.

Gupta, Professor: Department of Finance and Business Economics, University of Delhi View Program Marketing Performance Marketing for eCommerce Brands By - Zafer Mukeri, Founder- Inara Marketers View Program If a sequel is greenlit, it’s unlikely we would see it before 2026, as production would need to start soon, as per a report by Digital Spy. However, Netflix will only consider the sequel, if the first season performs well and as per multiple media outlets, the response has been lukewarm. Returning Cast: Who Could Be Back for Pretties? While nothing is confirmed, we can expect several familiar faces to return for Pretties. Joey King, who starred as Tally Youngblood and served as an executive producer, is likely to reprise her role. Keith Powers , Brianne Tju , Jan Luis Castellanos , and Laverne Cox are also expected to return. One of the more significant questions involves Chase Stokes, who plays Peris. In the original Uglies book, Peris survives, but the movie adaptation hinted at a possible change to his fate. If the film stays true to the sequel novel, Peris will feature in key moments, meaning Stokes may return. Also Read : NHL 25: Release date, early access, cover athletes, platforms, trailer, features and gameplay New characters from the second book are also expected to join the cast, including Zane, the founder of the Crims, and other members of New Pretty Town’s elite social group. Plot: What Could Happen in Uglies 2? The first Uglies movie closely followed the events of the book, ending with Tally agreeing to undergo the transformation into a Pretty to help test a cure for the brain lesions that affect society’s elite. Pretties, the second book, picks up with Tally now fully integrated into the life of a Pretty. However, she begins to sense that something is wrong with her new reality. A message from her past soon disrupts her perfect life, forcing Tally to confront difficult choices: Should she fight to forget the truth and remain in her comfortable world, or should she reclaim the life she left behind? The sequel explores Tally’s internal struggle, her interactions with new characters like Zane and the Crims, and the consequences of the decisions she made in the first story. While Uglies made slight deviations from the book, particularly with Peris, Pretties is expected to remain faithful to the themes of the novel, potentially introducing new twists to keep viewers engaged. Trailer and Future Updates As Uglies 2 has yet to be officially confirmed, there is no trailer or teaser footage available for Pretties. Fans may have to wait until Netflix provides an update on the future of the series. The first trailer for Uglies was released only a month before the film’s debut, so a similar timeline could be expected if a sequel is announced. FAQs How many books are in the Uglies series? Uglies is a young adult book series by Scott Westerfeld, initially planned as a trilogy. After releasing the first three novels—Uglies, Pretties, and Specials—Westerfeld decided to add a fourth installment, Extras. What happens in the second Uglies book? Tally has finally achieved her dream of becoming Pretty. With flawless looks, a charming boyfriend, and a fantastic group of friends, her life seems perfect—just as she always wanted. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

The same survey had been consistently predicting earlier that Kamala Harris has the edge over the former US President, and after the DNC 2024, things were appearing to go Harris' way, based on the YouGov poll. Even in the September 1 to September 3 survey by YouGov, Harris was leading by at least 2 points against the former US President. The survey, conducted between September 8 to September 10 by the pollster, showed that both the candidates were tied in terms of choice, and this is actually the first time in more than a month, that Harris is not leading against Donald Trump in this survey. This could be a good sign as well as a glimmer of hope that Trump will still be able to push full throttle in the next two months, and manage a thumping victory against Kamala Harris. Will Donald Trump be able to pull off a win? Nothing can be said as of now, looking at the fact that the contest is vey close between Harris and Trump. The lopsided Presidential Debate has also contributed by some means in these elections, and some fresh polls will be able to clarify exactly how much the Kamala Harris vs Trump debate fared in the poll race. FAQs: Is Kamala Harris ahead in the US poll race? Kamala Harris is a definite favorite in the US poll race, but some polls suggest that Donald Trump is also closing in on his Democrat rival.

Harris has been seen as phenomenal in the recently concluded US Presidential Debate, and is also a very sharp politician, and therefore, it can be assumed that she would have some trick up her sleeve to counter this tax plan narrative. Trump's tax plan speech welcomed by Americans Trump's big speech during a rally in Tucson, Arizona, on Thursday, included the fact that he would end all taxes on overtime, which would mean that the extra manual labor hours put in by Americans would be completely rewarded by the US economy and the government. This is something very new and innovative at this point and things could indeed go Trump's way if Americans actually consider this as a primary election promise. Trump has claimed that he has come to this decision of waiving taxes for overtime after consulting multiple economists, who are onboard with this though of his.

He alleged that those involved in these 'unfair' methods used to make him lose the elections, would be prosecuted severely, in the case that he is voted to power in the upcoming US Presidential elections.

He says, do your own research Trump also called for military tribunals against Barack Obama In the earlier Truth Social posts by the former US President, he had called for military tribunals against former President Barack Obama and his associated for the 2021 attack on the Capitol. Trump has always been very vocal about using his executive powers and bringing his 'enemies to justice', something that has not been perceived very well by the international community, as it somehow looks like the exercising of executive power in the wrong way. Some legal experts have criticized these statements by Trump, claiming that this was quite similar to President Vladimir exercising undue powers to subdue his rivals. This runs on the borderline of 'extremism' and 'treason', suggest reports.

According to a report published by Axios on Thursday, Loomer had been egging him on during the flight after Trump's other advisors advised caution and attempted to persuade him to stick to his messages about important voter concerns like the economy rather than pursuing long-standing grievances and easily refuted conspiracies like the idea that immigrants from Haiti are eating people's pets.

Loomer posted an extremely racist message about Vice President Kamala Harris on X, and Greene chastised her for it.

Loomer's tweet from September 8 referenced a post by Harris that highlighted her South Asian heritage. Loomer, a 9/11 conspiracist, accompanied Trump to the sombre memorial services on Wednesday in New York City and Pennsylvania three days later, the day following the debate. Greene decided it was finally time to speak out against discrimination. He had previously used racist and homophobic slurs and said that being called a white supremacist was equivalent to calling a black person the n-word. She referred to Loomer's post on X and declared on Wednesday that it is appalling and extremely racist, and it's not representative of MAGA or Republicans as a whole. This is not how President Trump is represented. This kind of conduct ought to never be accepted. Greene urged Loomer to take down the offensive post.

Greene and Loomer, both MAGA figures, have a history of flirting with antisemitic tropes and opposing antisemitism awareness bills. Their feuding remains unresolved, with Loomer attending 9/11 memorial ceremonies as a guest. FAQs What publicly exposed the division in Trump's inner circle?

Clarkson’s comments come as the final episode of The Grand Tour, titled One For The Road, premiered on Prime Video, marking an end to an era of collaboration between Clarkson, James May, and Richard Hammond. Top Gear and The Grand Tour history Top Gear, which Clarkson began hosting in 2002, alongside co-presenters Richard Hammond and later James May, became one of the BBC's most successful and globally recognized shows. Its unique mix of car reviews, challenges, and banter between the three presenters resonated with audiences worldwide.

Clarkson expressed gratitude that Top Gear had \"grown out of something else\" before evolving into the cultural phenomenon it became. “I started in 2002, doing originally just with Hammond, and then May came along in the second season of the series,” he explained, reflecting on the show's journey. This format helped solidify the trio's chemistry, which translated well to their later collaboration on The Grand Tour. The Final Farewell in The Grand Tour The Grand Tour was launched as a spiritual successor to Top Gear when the trio moved to Amazon Prime Video after Clarkson's controversial exit from the BBC. The show carried forward the same adventurous spirit and camaraderie but with larger, more expansive road trips. In the final episode, One For The Road, Clarkson, Hammond, and May embark on a road trip through Zimbabwe. The journey through beautiful yet challenging landscapes marks the end of a 22-year run of working together, leading to an emotional finale. As Clarkson explained, the episode is a nod to their earlier adventures. “The premise of the original Botswana film was: why, when you leave London and move to Surrey, do you always buy yourself a 4x4? You don’t need one. To prove this, we decided to drive three perfectly ordinary cars across Botswana.\" What’s Next for The Grand Tour? While The Grand Tour has come to an end with Clarkson, Hammond, and May at the helm, there is speculation about its future. Richard Hammond hinted that the series could continue with new presenters, although no concrete details have emerged. The trio’s departure marks the close of an era, but the concept of The Grand Tour may live on in a reimagined format.

FAQs How did Jeremy Clarkson lose Top Gear? In March 2015, the BBC announced Jeremy Clarkson's suspension following an alleged altercation in which he reportedly punched a producer over a dispute involving cold food and extended filming hours. As a result, the remaining episodes of the series were canceled. Who originally started Top Gear? The original show and its title were created by producer Derek Smith, who pitched the idea to BBC Midlands as a monthly television series. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

As per a Business Insider report, as soon as the Fed slashes interest rates, be it 25 or 50 bps, mid-cap stocks could see a far greater growth than others, helping in wealth generation for US investors, says Goldman Sachs. It is evident that ongoing recession fears could be detrimental for the US economy, but other market forces, including reduced inflation levels, are also being helpful to pacify US investors around the strength of the US economy. There is no official date around the Fed rate cut as of now, but as fears of an impeding recession grow stronger, some stocks are being forecasted to yield nearly 13% returns in the next year, following a rate slash. Mid-cap equities could be a major savior Mid-cap equities have, over the years, given significant returns to US investors, and with concerns around the volatility of the US economy, more people would begin relying on certain group of stocks in the mid-cap family for wealth generation in this scenario, feels Goldman Sachs. Moreover, mid-caps have the knack of offering optimum returns, in terms of growth and quality, and that too at a discounted price, which the large-caps do not offer. This makes it evident that US investors would turn to mid-cap stocks at this crisis period, and not rely on small-caps and large-cap stocks , that have poor profitability in vulnerable market conditions.

        "content": "A large tsunami that occurred in Greenland nine days ago due to glacier melting has been discovered by seismologists as an unprecedented event. Experts discovered unexplained vibrations in September of last year and located the source in a fjord in Greenland, where a landslide caused a wave that rose to a height of 650 feet. A unique phenomena that had never been seen before was created by the waves' constant bouncing against the walls of the fjord, as per the reports of Yahoo news. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} About 45 kilometers from the landslide on Ella Island, the tsunami also caused damage to a distant landmark. Waves at least thirteen feet high struck the island, which is frequented by Danish military personnel and scientists. Fortunately, no one was there when the accident happened, even though cruise ships had only been in the region a few days earlier. This seiche lasted longer than any previously documented seiche, as these episodes usually end in a few hours. Also Read : Nate Silver warns Kamala Harris of poll gains post U.S Presidential debate A growing problem linked to climate change While landslide tsunamis are not new, researchers believe they may be occurring more frequently. Landslides and the ensuing tsunamis are becoming increasingly frequent in the Arctic and subarctic due to the acceleration of permafrost erosion and glacier melting caused by climate change. A similar incident in Greenland in 2017 claimed four lives and destroyed multiple dwellings. Scientists are now concerned that as the world heats, more tsunamis may occur and affect vulnerable locations.

Alaskan geologist Bretwood Higman is researching the possibility of tsunamis resulting from landslides. Warmer weather increases the likelihood of intense rainfall, which erodes slopes and causes landslides, as he and other experts have noted. The likelihood of becoming victims of these tragedies increases as more people travel to these arctic areas for vacation and resource exploitation. FAQs What caused the 650-foot tsunami in Greenland? The tsunami was caused by a landslide triggered by melting glaciers in a Greenland fjord. This event led to massive waves that lasted for nine days. What damage did the tsunami cause?

According to the Independent's report, Trump fell for various baits laid out for him by Harris, and was even seen going on the offense when Harris talked about the small sizes of the crowd in some his rallies across the United States. Interestingly, this was a similar comment that Trump had consistently passed around Biden and Harris' initial campaign speeches across major US cities.

There is a lot of hope of an economic recovery towards the end of the year, after the US markets having facing a downslide over the past few weeks due to various market forces in play, and a fear of an impending recession among US investors. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Is the US economy actually heading for a stagflation? The chances of a stagflation cannot be taken off the table, feels Dimon, looking at the current US market scenario, which is behaving rather peculiarly, mostly due to the upcoming US Presidential elections, as well as the fears of an economic meltdown due to an incoming recession. Inflation has eased down a little over the past week, but the risks of it flaring up is high, looking at the fact that recession is also a nearing possibility in current circumstances. If the US economy indeed heads towards a stagflation, it could take months to steady the stock markets, which is already feeling the heat of the US elections, with Donald Trump and Kamala Harris already in a deadlock, in terms of winning possibilities. Inflation data showing recovery signs, other market factors in play While the inflation scenario is showing signs of dipping, there are other market forces that can drive the inflation back up, looking at the current fragile state of the US economy, which is not showing any sign of a proper recovery. If Dimon is to be believed, the US economy is not completely out of danger, and could still be at a major risk throughout the year. FAQs: Is inflation in the US reducing? US inflation data has shown signs of decrease, but could certainly flare up looking at the current state of the US economy, coupled with recession fears.

Could Harris get through on sheer nerve? Kamala Harris is currently in a very tricky position, but is still way ahead from the situation Joe Biden was in, when he was the Democratic Party candidate. However, there are still concerns whether her efforts in the last minute would still be enough for her and her Party to secure a victory against such a formidable candidate like Donald Trump.

According to the New York Times, it's Harris' largest 24-hour fundraising total since she raised $81 million after unseating President Biden as the Democratic nominee for president in July. The haul, which included contributions from 600,000 people, is Harris's most recent boost.

Jen O'Malley Dillon, chair of the Harris campaign, told the media that while their fundraising program continues to show historic strength, this momentum cannot be taken for granted. They must not undervalue Team Trump's power and their determined efforts to sow doubt and create division among Americans through effective fundraising and organizing. Until they finally defeat Trump this November, they won't give up. Also Read : Inside Out 2: When will it stream on Disney+?

President Trump delivered a powerful debate performance where he dominated Kamala on the issues that matter to Americans, despite the moderators doing everything in their power to cover up for her. There has been no response from the Trump campaign on how much money it had raised following Tuesday's debate.

This revelation brings even more tension into their already strained relationship, as mentioned in a report by TV Insider. The Evolution of Jax and Lewis’s Relationship Showrunner Raamla Mohamed shed light on Jax and Lewis’s journey in Season 2, revealing that both characters need to grow if their marriage is to survive. “We’re going to see two people who really love each other and want to make it work, and also see how both of them have to grow,” Mohamed shared as per a TV Insider’s report, emphasizing that while Season 1 focused on Jax’s growth, this season turns the spotlight on Lewis. “Lewis isn’t perfect either,” Mohamed teased, noting that the audience will witness his own struggles and development.

Mohamed pointed out that while Jax appreciates Corey’s help, she struggles with relinquishing control to him.

Despite being portrayed as somewhat of a villain, Corey is likable. “He bonds with Daniel [Tim Jo] and Krystal [Angela Grovey], and he makes great points about what he wants to do,” Mohamed added. This multi-dimensionality of Corey’s character adds another layer to the ongoing drama. Jax's Loyalty to Shanelle While her relationship with Lewis may be faltering, Jax remains steadfast in her loyalty to her friend Shanelle. Even amid Shanelle’s legal troubles, Jax is determined to stand by her, showcasing the strength of female friendships. Mohamed emphasized the importance of portraying these friendships authentically. “I think that female friendships, especially close ones, and also portraying friendships where people aren’t just dismissive or judgmental is important,” Mohamed explained, noting that these dynamics create relatability for viewers.

        "content": "Hyderabad: The Telangana Government on Tuesday requested the 16th Finance Commission to increase the share of states in Central taxes from the existing 41 per cent to 50 per cent as over the years cesses and surcharges that are not shared with states have increased. Deputy Chief Minister in-charge of Finance Bhatti Vikramarka in his speech at the meeting with Finance Commission Chairman Arvind Panagariya and members also urged the finance panel to ensure that states are given the necessary autonomy to tailor CSS programmes to their specific development needs. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} \"In addition, we propose increasing the share of states in Central taxes from 41 per cent to 50 per cent. Over the years, cesses and surcharges that are not shared with states have increased, leaving states with a smaller share of total gross tax revenue ,\" he said. Increasing the vertical devolution will give states the fiscal space they need to strengthen welfare programmes, address infrastructure gaps and prioritise local development, he further said. He, however, said it is not just a demand for Telangana but for all states, ensuring a more cooperative federal structure that will benefit the nation as a whole. Bhatti further said the state government urges the Finance Commission to reconsider the use of per capita income distance as the primary indicator in determining horizontal devolution as measuring prosperity and well-being solely by per capita income would deny Telangana the resources needed to address the inequities that exist within the state.

This approach would not only make states more competitive but also help reduce regional disparities, encouraging more balanced growth across the country,\" he opined. Pointing out that certain expenditures for schemes such as Rythu Bharosa , farm loan waivers and food subsidies are often mislabelled as \"freebies,\" he urged the Commission to recognise these programmes as necessary investments in the welfare of our people. He mentioned that a large part of the state's resources is now being diverted toward debt servicing and hence requested the Finance Commission's support in either restructuring this debt or providing additional assistance to help free up resources for further development. The 16th Finance Commission, led by its chairman Arvind Panagariya, held meetings with several political parties, representatives of local bodies and industry chambers here on Monday as part of its visit to Telangana. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

        "content": "A rebound in government expenditure is evident from a build-up of surplus liquidity conditions in the banking sector, as the Centre loosens its purse strings and injects cash into the system. The absence of the key driver of economic growth had been felt in the first quarter of the year. Analysts are of the view that the Reserve Bank of India’s tolerance of surplus liquidity suggests it could be gradually gearing up toward a softer monetary policy . #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Last week, while emphasising that India’s growth story remains intact after a lower-than-expected expansion of 6.7% in the GDP in June quarter, central bank governor Shaktikanta Das buttressed his statement by saying that government expenditure would pick up pace for the rest of the year in line with budget estimates. Banking system metrics suggest that the pick-up has been steadily underway for the last couple of months. For all of July, August and so far in September, the banking system has experienced surplus liquidity conditions, with the average amount of funds lenders have parked with the Reserve Bank of India on a daily basis clocking in at Rs 1.34 lakh crore, an analysis of central bank data showed. When the RBI absorbs funds from banks it indicates the prevalence of surplus liquidity conditions. From a peak of more than Rs 5 lakh crore in May, when elections were in full swing, the government’s cash balance has dropped sharply now, indicating the Centre’s spending push. “The rise in liquidity conditions represents a pick-up in government expenditure post the election,” said Gaura Sengupta, chief economist, IDFC First Bank . “This is reflected in the reduction of the government cash surplus to Rs 2.3 lakh crore as of August 2024 from peak levels of Rs 5.1 lakh crore as of May 24.” Banking system liquidity was broadly in deficit mode in May and June.

Gupta, Professor: Department of Finance and Business Economics, University of Delhi View Program Marketing Digital Marketing By - Zafer Mukeri, Founder- Inara Marketers View Program Spending by the government typically flows through the banking system, thereby increasing cash with lenders, although expenditure reforms by the Centre over the past few years have reduced that float. Das had said last week that the headline GDP growth number for the first quarter had printed lower than expectation, perhaps due to muted spending by the Centre and states during the general elections, which ended in early June. Borrowing Costs, RBI Stance The easier cash conditions in the banking system over the past two months have brought down the weighted average rate for the overnight segment of money markets, which represents banks’ overnight cost of funds. “One of the most notable statements in the recent speech by the RBI governor was that the balance for growth and inflation is very well poised. This is a significant shift from the August policy statement where he mentioned unambiguous focus on inflation,” said Anubhuti Sahay, head, India, economic research, Standard Chartered Bank. “Assuming there are no negative surprises on inflation, I think the comfort with liquidity is likely to remain and that can then move a step forward by bringing a change in stance and then probably rate cuts beginning by the end of the year.” The weighted average rate for the overnight segment of money markets has averaged 6.38% from July 1 to September 5, 12 basis points lower than the central bank’s repo rate of 6.50%. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. The easier liquidity and lower cost of overnight funds has reduced yields on the government’s treasury bills, which are used as pricing benchmarks for various credit products across the economy. From an auction on June 26 to the latest on September 4, yields on T-bills of different maturities have dropped 17 basis points to 24 basis points, RBI data showed. In 2023, when the RBI was faced with an abrupt rise in food inflation in the second half of the year, the central bank was averse to tolerating surplus liquidity in the banking system, given its potential inflationary impact. In the last few months, the RBI has taken some steps to rein in the amount of rupee liquidity being added to the banking system through foreign flows into debt. The central bank has conducted open market bond sales worth a total Rs 18,225 crore through secondary market operations between mid-July and now. However, it has stopped short of conducting large-scale, open-market sales of government bonds through auctions. Indian debt markets received net inflows worth $4.8 billion in July and August, official depository data showed. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

The ratio is 90:10 for the north-eastern states and three Himalayan states and Union Territories. The government's allocation for the flagship universal health coverage scheme was increased in the budget for 2024-25 to ₹7,300 crore from the revised estimate of ₹6,800 crore for the financial year. It is not yet clear if this would suffice to absorb the additional cost for increased central share on account of the latest extension of the scheme to senior citizens . For now, however, the government has yet to accept the other expansion proposal to double the health coverage to ₹10 lakh which could increase the overall cost to the exchequer considerably.

It is expected to benefit about 45 million families - with 60 million senior citizens - with free health insurance cover of ₹5 lakh per family per annum. An electoral promise that figured prominently in the BJP's manifesto ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, the expanded AB-PMJAY could, however, spark political controversy over central funding . At present, about a dozen states are already giving a range of health coverage benefits to senior citizens over 70 years of age, at their own cost. The latest expansion of AB-PMJAY will allow them the opportunity to get 60:40 fund sharing, with the Centre footing a larger share of the bill. This process, however, will involve merging the component with the centrally sponsored scheme and adopting its rulebooks and nomenclature, which underlines the central role. The Centre is unlikely to allow separation of the expanded scope of the scheme - health coverage for those above 70 years of age - as an independent scheme, according to the people cited earlier. Several such schemes have run into rough weather, especially in the opposition-ruled states, on account of political messaging. A case in point is Tamil Nadu's continued wrangling with the Union education ministry over the PM SHRI model school scheme tied up with Samagra Shiksha funding. Similar instances have been seen in West Bengal and Punjab, among other states. The original AB PM-JAY scheme also took time to scale up for similar reasons. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

Institutions like IIT Delhi have been asked to pay ₹120 crore, including penalties, over the past seven years. Others are facing demands ranging from ₹5 crore to ₹60 crore. Infosys co-founder T V Mohandas Pai voiced his discontent on social media, tagging GST India and PM Modi, calling the situation “tax terrorism.” Also Read: IIT-Delhi, Anna University & several other institutes get GST notice “GST on research grants will reduce money allocated for research. So, the govt must remove GST,” said Kris Gopalakrishnan, another Infosys co-founder who is a strong advocate for education and funds research projects in institutions like IIT and Indian Institute of Science . ToI said, according to experts, research inherently involves risks, and without the burden of taxes, institutions are more likely to invest in innovative, high-risk projects potentially leading to groundbreaking discoveries. They argue that some significant research studies span several years.

Gupta, Professor: Department of Finance and Business Economics, University of Delhi View Program Marketing Digital Marketing By - Zafer Mukeri, Founder- Inara Marketers View Program Orthopaedic surgeon Dr George Thomas, former editor of the Journal of Indian Medical Ethics, emphasized the importance of long-term investments in research. “The Framingham Heart Study, for instance, is a long-term, ongoing cardiovascular cohort study of residents of Massachusetts that began in 1948,” he said. “The National Institutes of Health invested USD 14 million in the Lower Extremities Assessment Project , a comprehensive research initiative designed to evaluate and improve outcomes in patients with severe injuries of the legs. Without large investments, breakthrough research is difficult. Taxing research grants reduces the already low investments.” Researchers also pointed out that funds for research have not increased in line with inflation, while the scope of research has expanded. Scientist Ashok Jhunjhunwala, who has chaired government committees and boards of institutions like IIT, suggests that GST on research grants could be absorbed by the grantee. “When researchers receive grant money from the ministry, the govt should pay the GST. Researchers would welcome it because they currently pay GST on equipment or components bought with grant funds. If grants were given with GST already paid, they could offset the GST costs they currently bear,” he explained. Research grants are typically itemized with specific amounts allocated for equipment, components, travel, salaries, and overheads. “Where is the GST money supposed to come from within this? Placing a GST demand on research institutions is just harassment,” Jhunjhunwala further elaborated. Several universities are now preparing for litigation against the GST demand, but legal experts are urging the Centre to reconsider before the matter reaches the courts. “GST is levied on the supply of goods and services,” stated K Vaitheeswaran, an advocate and tax expert heading the taxation committee of the Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “For example, at a shop there is a tax on sold goods. GST is on the supply of goods or services for consideration. When a university receives a research grant, there is no quid pro quo to provide any goods or services. A grant is not a consideration; it is akin to a donation.” Legal experts argue that research outcomes are uncertain and may not always result in saleable goods or services. Therefore, research grants and donations, whether from government or private agencies, should not be taxed based on anticipated outcomes but on actual monetized results. They further noted, “When income tax provides an accelerated tax shield for research institutions notified under section 35, GST too should extend the same reasoning and logic for research grants.” Delhi Minister Atishi expressed her opposition to GST on research grants and other services during a GST Council meeting. “Show cause notices have been sent to big educational institutes including IIT Delhi and Punjab University. It is wrong. Research is an investment in development of the country. There shouldn't be a GST on research grants. On one hand, the Centre is decreasing the research grants and on the other, they are levying GST. We will oppose it,” she said. She also noted concerns about GST potentially being levied on online payments via gateways, which could burden startups. Academicians are hopeful that this issue will be discussed at the GST Council meeting on September 9, chaired by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman . “Research grants to universities must be considered a subsidy as funds are used solely for delivering public good without any profit motive, making it a quasi-government endeavour by the university,” said one academician. T V Mohandas Pai suggested setting up an expert committee within GST India akin to the one at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. “Questions should be referred to this committee, position paper prepared, put out for public comments and after that issued as the official view,” he recommended. “This will ensure uniform policy throughout the industry and eliminate arbitrary action by GST officers which harm the country and business as well as reduce tax terrorism. Officials must raise contestable questions and debate it out before they issue such notices. Tax on research grants given to universities can have a chilling effect on research outputs. I hope it’s axed.” #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

        "content": "The GST Council ’s meeting on Monday added some flavor to the Indian tax system, announcing significant cuts aimed at making essential services and goods more affordable. Among the key reductions were tax cuts on cancer drugs, helicopter travel, and snacks like namkeen . #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} In a series of decisions, the Council reduced GST on select cancer medications to 5 per cent, cut the levy on fried snacks from 18 per cent to 12 per cent, and lowered the tax on shared helicopter rides to 5 per cent. Drugs : Among the most significant decisions, the reduction of GST on life-saving cancer drugs like Trastuzumab Deruxtecan , Osimertinib, and Durvalumab from 12 per cent to 5 per cent was praised as a step towards making these treatments more accessible. Industry experts highlighted the importance of this move, which complements the customs duty exemption for cancer drugs announced earlier this year. \"With the increasing burden of chronic diseases in India, this is a move toward making life-saving drugs accessible and improving health outcomes,\" said Sudarshan Jain , secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance. R&D activities : The Council also agreed to exempt research and development activities funded by private and public sources, including universities, from GST, marking a win for educational institutions engaged in R&D under central or state laws. Helicopter travel booking : The decision to reduce GST on helicopter travel booked on a 'seat-share' basis to 5 per cent will benefit travelers to popular pilgrimage destinations like Kedarnath-Badrinath and Vaishno Devi. However, chartered helicopter services will continue to attract the higher 18 per cent GST. Namkeens : The GST rate has been reduced prospectively from 18 per cent to 12 per cent for namkeens and savoury items. In addition to these tax reductions, the Council deferred decisions on two key issues: lowering GST on health and life insurance and extending the compensation cess beyond January 2026. These matters were referred to two ministerial panels for further consideration. The panel on insurance, led by Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Chaudhary , will review the exemption thresholds, treatment of senior citizens, and group insurance sales by resident welfare associations, with recommendations expected by the end of October. The Council also clarified that uncooked or unfried snack pellets will attract a 5 per cent tax, while increasing the GST on car and motorcycle seats from 18 per cent to 28 per cent. Roof-mounted package unit air conditioners used in railways were also moved into the highest GST slab. The decision on taxing electric vehicle charging stations was postponed.

They include Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana and Punjab. Madhya Pradesh Ladli Behna scheme proved to be a gamechanger for BJP in the last year's elections, but the state government is facing severe financial burden due to this and a few other poll promises.

In the last fiscal year, Madhya Pradesh borrowed ₹76,230 crore as per revised budget estimate, taking the total debt of the state to ₹4,18,056 crore. The BJP government is planning to borrow ₹94,431 crore this fiscal year. The state has allocated ₹18,984 crore for the Ladli Behna scheme this year. In addition, it offers ₹4,775 crore on agriculture pump subsidy, ₹3,500 crore for offering 100 units of electricity at ₹100, ₹6,290 crore on electricity subsidy to farmers and ₹1,231 crore for the Ladli Laxmi scheme for girls. The above subsidies and direct cash transfer amount to a total of ₹34,780 crore. This year, it made a provision of ₹1,17, 945 crore for salaries, pension and interest payment on loans. The state government has estimated a fiscal deficit of 4.1% of the state GDP or GSDP, which is higher than 3.5% recommended by the central government. In his budget speech, deputy chief minister Jagdish Devda had said the state will try to bring the fiscal deficit back to the prescribed limits. Karnataka The Congress government in March hired consultancy firm Boston Consulting to suggest measures to generate additional ₹55,000-60,000 crore to fulfil the five guarantees it promised to the people during elections in 2023. In June, the government increased sales tax on diesel and petrol saying the state needs funds to fulfil its guarantees. In FY24, the state spent ₹36,000 crore for the guarantees. This year, it has earmarked ₹53,674 crore for five guarantees. More than half of it has been allocated to the Gruha Lakshmi Scheme, which provides women head of each BPL family ₹2,000 per month. The other schemes include free power for agriculture, free bus rides for women and free units of electricity to households among others. Karnataka plans to borrow ₹1,05, 246 crore in the current budget. The state's borrowings have significantly increased over the past two years. Punjab The AAP government is spending ₹17,110 crore for free electricity to farmers and households. The state fiscal deficit is at 3.8% of the SGDP, higher than the recommended 3.5%. The outstanding liability on the state stands at ₹3,51,130 crore as of March 2024, according to RBI data. Telangana The Congress government has earmarked ₹20,378 crore for fulfilling the poll promises. The amount includes ₹15,470 crore for debt relief to farmers, ₹3,083 crore for Mahalakshmi free bus ride to women and ₹1,825 crore for free 200 units of electricity to households. The government is yet to provide the promised financial assistance to women under the Mahalakshmi scheme. In the budget, it announced a support of ₹12,000 annually to agriculture labourers and housing assistance of ₹5-6 lakh to SC/ST to help build 450,000 houses. Finance minister Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka in his budget speech said the state needs ₹31,000 crore for fulfilling farmers' loan waiver promise and it is working on ways to generate this money. The government is currently reviewing all the ongoing schemes to rationalise them and continue only those found to be useful for the state. This was mentioned in the budget document of 2024-25. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

Briefing reporters on the outcome of the 54th GST Council meeting on Monday, Sitharaman said it had mandated a group of ministers to look into the GST on life and health insurance premiums. The GoM has been asked to submit its report by October end, she said, adding that the issue would then be taken up at the November meeting of the council. The GoM will be headed by Bihar deputy chief minister Samrat Choudhary, who also leads the panel on GST rate rationalisation. The issue of taxation of insurance premiums had come up in parliament with opposition members asking that they be exempted from GST. First GST meeting since PM Modi's third term This was the first meeting of the GST Council after the formation of the new government at the Centre in June. The GST Council also decided to set up a GoM to decide on the roadmap for the compensation cess beyond March 2026 and will take a call on the additional ₹40,000 crore collected after adjusting for back-to-back loans taken by the states and interest. The minister said a committee of secretaries headed by additional secretary, revenue, will be formed on integrated GST, which is currently facing a negative balance. It will look into ways to retrieve the money from states. Other decisions The council approved the introduction of B2C e-invoicing to facilitate consumers on a voluntary basis in select states. It also decided to bring renting of commercial property by unregistered persons to a registered person and supply of scrap under the reverse charge mechanism under GST to prevent revenue leakage. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

Vijayan was speaking at a conclave of five non-BJP-ruled states organised by Kerala to discuss the key issues related to the 16th Finance Commission. He said that the 16th Finance Commission needs to factor in this rising trend in surcharges and cesses, when it recommends the prescribed share of the states from the net proceeds of taxes collected by the union government. The CM further said that the share of the states in the divisive pool needs to be increased further from the 41 per cent recommended by the last Finance Commission . He said that Kerala and many other states have made this demand in the past with the southern state suggesting that it be increased to 50 per cent. \"The demand for a higher share for the states in the taxes collected by the Union is having continued relevance and it is my request to the eminent scholars and colleagues who are here to formulate this in a concrete manner. \"This will help the states to make an effective case before the 16th Finance Commission for raising the share of taxes which are distributed to the states, in view of the widening vertical fiscal Imbalances,\" Vijayan said. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

Gupta, Professor: Department of Finance and Business Economics, University of Delhi View Program Marketing Digital Marketing By - Zafer Mukeri, Founder- Inara Marketers View Program The 54th GST Council meeting was expected to bring relief to individuals and senior citizens with a significant decision on the Goods and Services Tax rate applied to health insurance premiums. The current GST rate on health and life insurance policies stands at 18 per cent, and the industry was expecting that this could be reduced to ease the financial burden on policyholders. A report on the implications of GST levied on life, health, and reinsurance premiums will be presented to the GST Council, reported PTI, citing sources. After reviewing this report, the Council was expected to discuss whether to proceed with a reduction in the GST rate on health insurance premiums. There was also a speculation that the GST on health insurance premiums could be slashed from 18 per cent to nil. The fitment committee, consisting of central and state tax officials, convened on Sunday to weigh the pros and cons of reducing the GST rate on health premiums. Additionally, the GST Council is expected to address other financial matters, such as the taxation of online payments exceeding Rs 2,000. Currently, online transactions made through payment gateways are not subject to GST, and this issue was likely to be discussed during the meeting. West Bengal Finance Minister Chandrima Bhattacharya had already submitted a request to reduce the 18 per cent GST rate on life and health insurance premiums. Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Chaudhary, who leads the reconstituted Group of Ministers on GST for rate rationalisation, acknowledged last month that changes to health insurance tax rates are under review. The GST Council, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and comprising state finance ministers, is responsible for determining the tax rate adjustments. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

The GST council also brought about changes in the law and rates to rectify unintended levies and demands starting with exempting import of services by an establishment of a foreign airlines company from a related person outside India, when made without consideration and regularizing past cases on an ‘as is where is’ basis thereby putting to rest the huge demands that were raised on foreign airlines in the recent past. Further, clarifying the place of supply in case of advertising services and data-hosting services when provided to foreign entity to be the location of recipient thereby to be treated as export of services, are all decisions that will help resolve multiple ongoing litigations and provide the much-needed relief to the respective industries. Want to know what GST Council decided in 54th meeting? Click Here Another key outcome of the council meeting was the formulation of two new GoMs which have been created to find possible solutions to some critical issues, namely – GoM on life and health insurance and GoM to study the future of compensation cess with the mandate to present their findings by Oct 24 end to enable the council to deliberate on the same and achieve consensus. GoM has further made an effort to streamline the metal industry by accepting their long standing demand of making the payment on reverse charge for supply of metal screap from unregistered dealers. However, given that intermediate dealers may be unregistered there is a possibility of substantial cascading in certain situations. Accordingly, the fine print is awaited to understand the complete implications.

Also, the IMS system is a major step to bring efficiency in credit availment and was proposed in the initial implementation of the GSTN portal, but deferred due to technical issues. However, there is a need to make explicit provisions under law to give it a legal backing. Both these changes will take compliances to a new level and would bring maturity to the current GST processes. Here's everything Finance Minister Sitharaman and the GST Council decided With every meeting, the council takes a step towards streamlining and resolving disputes under the GST law. While a lot has already been achieved by the Council, the same is a continued journey of democratized decision making. While the decisions taken by GST Council are a testament to the government's commitment to fostering a conducive business environment, it is the need of the hour that the council develops a long-term vision for this tax. There are two main areas which require council’s immediate attention - the first is re-evaluation of ITC admissibility, which will not only require a complete re-look at Section 17 of GST law which restricts credits in some cases but also look at sectors where credits have been restricted to keep the rates low. The second area which requires immediate attention is the multiplicity of audits, assessment and investigations being carried out on large corporates across the country. Multiple organizations, as part of their revenue augmentation targets, audit and investigate the corporates, most of them having multiple registrations in various jurisdictions. It is time that the council re-formulate the audit process to have centralised coordinated audits with possible rotation between centre and state. The GST Council's proactive approach in addressing the concerns of industry is a reassuring sign of the government's dedication to making India an easier place to do business. The nation now looks forward to the findings of the GoMs which are set to pave the way for a more streamlined and efficient tax system, ultimately contributing to the overarching goal of ease of doing business in India. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

It came into effect from October 1, 2023. Earlier, skill-based games were taxed at 18 percent. This is in addition to the tax on winnings from different gaming tournaments that are either in the form of cash or gift prize. As per the income tax law, these winnings are treated as winnings from online games and taxed at 30 per cent under the head 'Income from other Sources'. Prime Minister Nardendra Modi had recently acknowledged the country’s gaming potential, saying in his Independence Day speech, “I am seeing a big market that has come up in the field of gaming, but even today, the gaming world has a big foreign impact in terms of producing the games and earning revenues. India has a big heritage in the area and we can bring lots of new talent to the world of gaming.” Artificial Intelligence Java Programming with ChatGPT: Learn using Generative AI By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead Instructor View Program Artificial Intelligence Basics of Generative AI : Unveiling Tomorrow's Innovations By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead Instructor View Program Artificial Intelligence Generative AI for Dynamic Java Web Applications with ChatGPT By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead Instructor View Program Artificial Intelligence Mastering C++ Fundamentals with Generative AI: A Hands-On By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead Instructor View Program Artificial Intelligence Master in Python Language Quickly Using the ChatGPT Open AI By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead Instructor View Program Office Productivity Zero to Hero in Microsoft Excel: Complete Excel guide 2024 By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead Instructor View Program Astrology Vastu Shastra Course By - Sachenkumar Rai, Vastu Shashtri View Program Data Science SQL for Data Science along with Data Analytics and Data Visualization By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead Instructor View Program Web Development A Comprehensive ASP.NET Core MVC 6 Project Guide for 2024 By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead Instructor View Program Office Productivity Mastering Microsoft Office: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and 365 By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead Instructor View Program Marketing Digital marketing - Wordpress Website Development By - Shraddha Somani, Digital Marketing Trainer, Consultant, Strategiest and Subject Matter expert View Program Finance Financial Literacy - TDS, Budget, Income Tax Act, GST, Indirect tax By - CA Rahul Gupta, CA with 10+ years of domain experience, trainer View Program Leadership Business Storytelling Masterclass By - Ameen Haque, Founder of Storywallahs View Program Future of Marketing & Branding Masterclass By - Dr. David Aaker, Professor at Haas School of Business View Program HR & People Management Human Potential and the Future of Employment By - Lynda Gratton, Co-chair of the World Economic Forum Council on Work, Wages and Job Creation, Professor of Management Practice View Program Strategy ESG and Business Sustainability Strategy By - Vipul Arora, Partner, ESG & Climate Solutions at Sattva Consulting Author I Speaker I Thought Leader View Program Finance Financial Reporting and Analytics By - Dr. C.P. Gupta, Professor: Department of Finance and Business Economics, University of Delhi View Program Marketing Digital Marketing By - Zafer Mukeri, Founder- Inara Marketers View Program How has the gaming industry fared after the hike in GST? Reports suggest that the industry has struggled since the increase in GST. According to a study by EY, the placement of online games in the highest tax bracket has affected the industry negatively. A USISPF survey found companies facing challenges in raising funding, making a good margin and have seen a stalled revenue since the GST rates were hiked. This change resulted in a higher tax burden for companies operating the online gaming sector, most of which had to function with the increase in tax to sustain their operations. Of the companies surveyed in the study, just 42 percent reported revenue growth following the GST amendment. The growth ranged from 1-25 per cent, while 58 per cent companies faced revenue decline or stagnation. This includes two companies with a massive 50 percent decrease in revenue. This represents a notable shift from the industry's prior trend of exponential growth and highlights the significant financial impact of GST on the online gaming sector. The hike in GST, absorbed by the companies, led to reduced margins and triggered workforce reductions, including layoffs, hiring freezes, and in some cases, operations were completely shut. What do gaming companies want? Most companies have recommended an amendment of the GST valuation mechanism to a ‘net deposit’ model , and some companies have recommended reducing the total withdrawals from the total deposits for GST purposes. The online gaming industry has been filing returns since 2017, but they paid 18 percent from August 18, 2017 and October 2023. The issue got complex with the GST department's decision that all games involving bets played between August 2017 and October 1 2023 would have to pay a tax of 28 per cent instead of the earlier 18 per cent. As many as 71 online gaming companies have received tax notices to pay a total of Rs 1.12 lakh crore, with some demands surpassing their annual turnover, according to the GST department's calculations. India currently has 442 million gamers, the second largest in the world behind China. The industry is valued at $3.1 billion and is expected to grow to $8.92 billion in the next five years. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

The chief minister, who had promised to implement the \"Mukhya Mantri Mahila Samman Yojana\" for providing a monthly honorarium of Rs 1,000 to women above 18 years, can launch the scheme ahead of the assembly polls, due early next year. The top court, while granting bail to Kejriwal in a corruption case linked to the alleged excise policy scam lodged by the Central Bureau of Investigation , directed the terms and conditions -- as imposed in the Enforcement Directorate's money-laundering case in the same matter -- would also be applicable in his release. The apex court, while granting bail to the AAP chief in the ED case on July 12, had said Kejriwal could not visit his office or the Delhi Secretariat and not sign any official file unless absolutely necessary to obtain the lieutenant governor's sanction.

Gupta, Professor: Department of Finance and Business Economics, University of Delhi View Program Marketing Digital Marketing By - Zafer Mukeri, Founder- Inara Marketers View Program AAP said in its statement, \"The only files that are signed by the chief minister are those that have to go to the lieutenant governor, for which he has permission from the Supreme Court. Therefore, no work of the people of Delhi will stop.\" At a press conference, senior AAP leader and former Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said, \"If these conditions are challenged in the court, they will not hold.\" Under the restrictions imposed by his bail conditions, the Delhi chief minister will be required to convene a meeting of his Cabinet, which has not been held since his March arrest. He also has to take a decision on calling a session of the Delhi Assembly as the last session was held in April. He will also be required to appoint a minister in his council to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Raaj Kumar Anand, decide the meeting date of the National Capital Civil Services Authority for IAS and other Group A postings, officials said. These are likely to be his priorities once he starts working, they said. AAP MLA and lawyer Somnath Bharti claimed that though the bail conditions said Kejriwal could not go to the Delhi Secretariat and work as chief minister, he was allowed to sign all files that required the lieutenant governor's approval. \"Almost all Delhi government files go to the lieutenant governor's office\" he said. In view of the \"shock\" expressed by Justice Ujjal Bhuyan over the bail conditions in the ED case, \"a door for future remedy is open\", Bharti added. \"Our legal team will look into all these aspects and may approach the Supreme Court for clarifications/relaxations, if and wherever required,\" he said. The presence of the chief minister alone will help \"speed up\" many works, he asserted. The chief minister may be involved in a flurry of meetings at his camp office to speed up pending work on welfare schemes and infrastructure-related projects, ensuring availability of medicines and tests at hospitals and mohalla clinics, the officials said. He may also find ways to speed up work on the government's pending flagship schemes and policies, including the EV Policy 2.0, doorstep delivery of services and the Delhi Solar Policy, they said. Kejriwal may also actively engage with the lieutenant governor's office over issues related to the alleged halting of funds of important public service-oriented departments and agencies such as the Delhi Jal Board, health and public works departments, they added. Former Delhi chief secretary PK Tripathi said that although there was \"vagueness\" to the chief minister's power to sign files, nothing could stop him from working on schemes and projects for the welfare of the people. Even if the lieutenant governor's approval is needed, there may not be any problem in getting clearance for such works, he added. Launch of projects and schemes such as mohalla and premium buses, inauguration of hospitals, schools, flyovers, and new initiatives could materialise in the coming weeks in view of the upcoming polls, the officials said. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

The food items that are included in this are extruded or expanded savoury or salted products, excluding un-fried or un-cooked snack pellets produced through extrusion and classified under HS 1905 90 30. This aligns the rate with that of namkeens, bhujia, mixture, chabena , and similar ready-to-eat preparations classified under HS 2106 90. Snacks made using the extrusion process will be taxed at 18 percent. However, other snacks and savory items, such as bhujia, could potentially be subject to a 12 percent GST.

Currently, expanded snacks face an 18 percent GST, while regular savory snacks are taxed at 12 percent, which the recent ratification addressed. The Fitment Committee established by the Council recommended classifying these items as savory snacks.

In response, two new Groups of Ministers have been established - one to focus on medical and health insurance and another to decide the use of compensation cess after March 2025. Additionally, the GoM on rate rationalization, now including new members specifically for medical insurance, has been tasked with submitting a report in October for discussion at the committee's November meeting.

He was granted interim bail by the SC in the case. However, he was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation on June 26 in a separate excise policy case, while he was still in Tihar jail under judicial custody. \"Kejriwal getting conditional bail is not a special achievement, the trial will go on and he will soon get a long sentence. Kejriwal should remember that he has now joined the list of chief ministers like Lalu Yadav, Madhu Koda and they too had got bail and then sentenced,\" Sachdeva said. North East Delhi BJP MP Manoj Tiwari said that Kejriwal has become the first chief minister in the country who is not allowed to sign files and go to his office, for being accused in a \"corruption\" case. \"The condition of Delhi has worsened and if Kejriwal had any sympathy, he would not consider retaining the chief minister's post. Now, Delhi has a chief minister who has no powers,\" he said. Delhi BJP secretary Bansuri Swaraj, in a press conference, accused Aam Aadmi Party leaders of celebrating \"corruption\" and \"misleading people\" over the bail granted to Kejriwal. \"Kejriwal was granted bail by the court because the court found that the trial might be delayed,\" she claimed. Even the Supreme Court has found that Kejriwal's arrest was \"legally justified\", she said. \"Kejriwal had filed two petitions, one questioning the legality of his arrest and the other seeking bail. But the trial court, high court, and now the Supreme Court have all upheld that his arrest was legal,\" she said.

Dhankhar said one should always keep the nation above self interest and political interest . We cannot promote the enemy's interest under any circumstances, he said. \"It is a sad matter, a matter of concern, a matter of contemplation, a matter of churning that some of our misguided people are hurting mother India despite taking oath in the name of the Constitution. They are compromising with nationalism. They are unable to understand the concept of nation. I do not know with which selfish motive they want to bleed mother India. I will request them. Every Indian who steps outside the country is an ambassador of our nationalism, an ambassador of our culture,\" he said. He further said, \"Can we even imagine ... we will do such a thing which is not appropriate behaviour... It does not promote our nationalism, it is against our nationalism. Fulfill our dreams, why are you engaged in fulfilling the dreams of the enemies. History has never forgiven those who have behaved like this with the country.\" \"I pity them for their despicable, condemnable, reprehensible anti-national conduct , and that too outside the nation. I pray to the almighty to bestow wisdom on them,\" Dhankhar said. He said his job is not to do politics. Political parties should do their own work, they are entitled to work the work they wish to do, he said, adding ideologies will be different, attitude towards governance will be different. \"There is no problem in this. But there will be similarity in one thing and that is - nation is supreme,\" he said. Talking about the country's growth chart, the vice president said India today is known in the world as a country that is not dependent on others. \"The resonance of India's leadership, the influence of its leadership, the impact of its leadership is proving to be decisive in the world,\" he said. He said that we are in interesting times where we have no limitations. Be it land, water, air, space, India's echo is being heard by the world. \"Our progress is in every field. Everyone knows that we have no other place to live except Earth. We have to maintain it, restore it.

Both the temple practice and the folktale draw attention to the worldview of ancient Indians. Bad times follow good times, good times follow bad times, like a wave. But this is not the worldview of monotheistic religions that arose in the Middle East. The Jewish Bible ends with the breaking of the Jewish temple, and the promise of its rise eventually. The Christian Bible turns the Jewish Bible into the Old Testament and in its New Testament declares that resurrection of Jesus Christ is actually the rebuilding of the temple. Temple is a metaphor for the messiah. The Muslims say that the final Messiah appeared six centuries after Jesus, in Mecca to replace ignorance with knowledge. Here there is no concept of rise and fall, owing to tensions between multiple ideas. There is an endless rise of one correct idea. That is why corporations speak of endless growth, quarter after quarter, despite rise and fall of stock markets. Million-dollar firms aspire to be billion-dollar companies which aspire to be zillion-dollar companies. The past is the Old Testament. The future is the New Testament. Politicians, and businessmen, try this same Western narrative to win elections in India. The building of broken temples. The move towards a trillion dollar economy. The happily ever after. And like Middle Eastern religions, they end up creating Holy Wars and Crusades.

Gupta, Professor: Department of Finance and Business Economics, University of Delhi View Program Marketing Performance Marketing for eCommerce Brands By - Zafer Mukeri, Founder- Inara Marketers View Program Ancient Vedic ritual halls were set aflame to remind everyone that nothing is permanent. Buddha said the same thing. So did the Tirthankaras. Even today Hindu rituals involve building images of gods using perishable materials like straw, clay and flowers. After a few days of worship, the images are thrown in the river. A reminder that gods who come eventually go away. There is no endless rise, or relentless fall. We rise with ladders and fall with snakes. One follows the other. Such is life's game. When Hindu temples were being destroyed by Muslim warlords from Central Asia, the Vaishnava saints used the musical traditions to create temples of songs. In the songs, they created the divine seated in the hearts of the devotees. The entire ritual took the form of bhajans and kirtans. This is what marked the rise of the Vallabha and the followers of Chaitanya. The point was to adapt, find new ways to evoke the divine. Jain temples were also destroyed by iconoclasts from the Middle East. So instead of building stone structures, they sponsored the writing and illustration of Jain manuscripts. These books could be stored easily. Slowly, as things became safer, temple building resumed. By this time, some Jains even advised against idols and temples, and preferred sustaining the faith through discourses of holy men and women. We never hear of Jain victims or martyrs. The faith speaks of responding to the social realities. The faith reminds the faithful that it is eternal. So it does not need to be saved or sold. Misfortune was never tragedy, just a part of life. Both Right Wing and Left Wing politicians prefer the Middle Eastern and Western discourse. They argue how the world needs saving and their ideology needs to be evangelised. Businessmen do the same thing. In declarations, they insist that society can be saved if they make more profits. Everyone talks of rebuilding a broken temple, a broken city, a broken system. This 'global' discourse needs to be challenged with new ideas. The acceptance of diversity. The acceptance of change. No empire lasts forever. No religion lasts forever. No ideology lasts forever. When we think with an expiry date in mind, we will deposit our wealth, earned in good times, to benefit those in bad times, like royal gold in temples of yore. Rather than imagine an eternal paradise, we will revel in the snake-ladder game, use ladders to help snakes, and use snakes to restrain ladders. This wisdom of balance, of churning, is the need of the hour. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

Gupta, Professor: Department of Finance and Business Economics, University of Delhi View Program Marketing Performance Marketing for eCommerce Brands By - Zafer Mukeri, Founder- Inara Marketers View Program Perhaps that was the region – Inderjit was given special appreciation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in run up to Lok Sabha polls and Union Home Minister Amit Shah in run up to assembly polls in Haryana. A section of BJP’s Haryana unit claims that he was in touch with Congress ahead of the Lok Sabha polls and the saffron party didn’t want him to leave. Sensing that he is becoming more relevant for the party, Inderjit is making moves by wielding his weight – first he projected himself as CM contender and openly supported Ram Bilas Sharma after BJP leadership denied him the ticket. Recently addressing a gathering in Rewari, Inderjit said \"It's the people who want to see me as chief minister. They have given their verdict through elections. Right now, Nayab Saini’s kite is flying high in the sky.” Singh made these remarks even though BJP top brass has announced Saini as its CM face for Haryana assembly polls. In a similar fashion, he openly came out in support of Sharma after he was denied ticket from Mahendergarh saying that this is not the appropriate way as Sharma raised the BJP in Haryana. He also said the party should consider him for Governor post. Inderjit supporters claim that the BJP has fielded several candidates on around twenty seats on his recommendation and even denied tickets to some of its leaders like Santosh Yadav. She was seeking a ticket from Ateli from where Inderjit’s daughter is contesting. The party even changed the seats of some of the sitting MLAs on his recommendation, his supporters claim. Despite the efforts to keep him in good humor, the BJP has given tickets to several leaders not to the liking of Inderjit including Rao Narbir Singh from Badshahpur. Many in the BJP see Inderjit becoming more relevant for the party as he is seen as the tallest Ahir leader with the potential to carry caste votes with him. But there are many disputes citing the recent Lok Sabha results, where his victory margin came down substantially and Ahirs are looking for a new leader. BJP has also made special efforts to consolidate its standing among OBCs in the state including Ahirs. Inderjit at times makes it clear that ideologically he has not fully subscribed to BJP-RSS ideology. He took a different stand from the party at the time of violence in Nuh in 2023 after a yatra carried by VHP in the muslim dominated region. Inderjit has enjoyed four stints as Union Minister – two during Congress rule and two under the Modi government but his heart lies in state politics. However, his relevance is still limited to the Ahirwal region. With passing time and changing political landscape, Ahirwal is also looking for a next generation leader and therefore Inderjit is trying to shift his legacy to his daughter Arti. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

Nidhi companies, governed by Section 406 of the Companies Act, are easy to form as they don't require any licence from the RBI. The minimum capital requirement for such a company is ₹10 lakh. It also needs at least seven members, of which three must be the directors of that entity. Hefty penalties on some The RoC for Tamil Nadu has imposed the highest penalty of ₹12.5 lakh on Sri Sathuragiri Nidhi, followed by Dhanalakshmi Srinivasan Nidhi and Arradiyaa Global Benefits Nidhi . These include penalties on the key personnel of these companies as well.

These companies include Eravanchery Nidhi, Madhvprabha Nidhi, Ramax Nidhi, Agniswari Nidhi, Ajay Nidhi, Abayambigai Nidhi and Appattuvilai St. Antony's Nidhi. Most of these are based out of Tamil Nadu. In separate orders, the RoC said Sathuragiri failed to file on time its financial accounts for three straight years through 2021-22. Dhanalakshmi's violations include non-submission of the e-form MGT-14 relating to approval of accounts and directors' report for three successive years through 2018-19. Similarly, Arradiyaa Global didn't file on time its financial statements and annual returns for FY21 and FY22. \"It's important to ensure various compliances by these companies as they can impact the lives of small investors who become their members,\" a senior RoC official said. \"These orders are expected to foster the much-needed discipline among them so that they take mandatory filings seriously,\" he added. Asish Philip, partner at law firm Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan, said: \"The imposition of penalties on Nidhi companies is in consonance with recent efforts by the RoC to tighten corporate governance norms in India\". Money is held in trust by Nidhi companies on behalf of its members, which \"imposes higher fiduciary duty on Nidhi companies in relation to compliance\", he said. \"Governance failure in such institutions leads to a loss of credibility and induces risk for the participants, thus defeating the purpose of such a special regime, which is to promote financial inclusion,\" Philip added. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

Asked the status of India-Iran ties in the face of changing global dynamics, the envoy said, \"The bilateral ties with India is not only good, but fantastic.\" India and authorities in India observed a day-long mourning when the then Iranian president Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi had died, and condolences expressed is registered in the \"national memory of Iran\". It is something unbelievable for Iran, and regarding the relations, \"the supreme leader of Iran respects India, and I as an an ambassador of Iran also fully feel the respect of PM Modi and the government of India,\" he added. The government of India had declared one-day national mourning on May 21 as a mark of respect to Raisi who had tragically passed away in a helicopter crash. Elahi said at the strategic level, both countries have good mindset about each other, and at the operative level, there are \"some difficulties\". \"We are in good relation with different structures of India to resolve these difficulties, we need some mechanism. Strategically, we see willingness on both the sides. We do not have any problems between the two countries. \"It is important. It is a strategic asset for both the countries. We have been together, we are now together, and we are now working to be in the future,\" the ambassador said. India and Persia, as Iran is historically known, are two ancient civilisations and have had ties in trade, culture and other sectors, going back to several centuries. \"Iran and India have a long-standing relation, and one aspect of our relation has been people-to-people relation and interactions. Unfortunately, Covid affected this relation. We organised this roadshow to reactivate and revive the good tourism cooperation between the two countries,\" he said. \"We believe that India needs to know more about the current Iran and development of Iran, as also Iranians also need to know more about India and the development of India, and the capabilities of the cooperation,\" the envoy added. The event saw gathering of different stakeholders of tourism -- travel agencies, airliners and officials from both the countries. \"They have opportunity to discuss different ways to promote tourism between the two countries. We recently have removed or resolved some concern of Indian, we have resolved the visa issue. \"Indians can enter Iran for two weeks without any visa, Indian passport holders are exempted from visa. \"Also, when they enter or depart Iran, their passport will not be stamped. So, they do not have concern regarding travelling or visiting other countries. This is an important issue,\" Elahi said. Another important issue is that the number of flights should be increased. Now, there are two direct flight between Delhi and Tehran, which take about three-and-a-half hours. Another flight between Tehran and Mumbai, which is about less than four hours. \"But, we plan to increase the number of flights.\" \"We have asked and approached Indian airline and trying to explain the capacity of the big market of Iran for Indian airlines. So, Indian carriers can be welcomed to set up direct flight not only from Delhi or Mumbai, but also Hyderabad, Bangalore, are good markets, and even Kashmir is good. Different cities of the two countries can be connected with direct flights, we welcome and we hope that Indian carriers can set up direct flights,\" he said. Asked what is the increased frequency of direct flights he is expecting, the envoy said, \"We are expecting at least one flight per day, seven-day a week flights.\" Elahi said this event is just a beginning in the long-drawn aim of cooperation and Iran hopes that after this event will witness promotion and progress in tourism between the two countries, on both the sides. \"We are insisting not just to attract Indian tourists, we are also insisting to attract Iranian tourists to India... According to the latest statistics, in the last year, more than 13 million Iranians have travelled aborad, but the portion that went to India is just about 58,000. \"It is nothing, very low . On the other hand, the number of Indians tourists going to Iran, the figure is huge. So, they can benefit from tourism cooperation. And, we hope that it is a good step,\" he added. Besides, Indians can not only buy good souvenirs from Iran but they can also do business with Iran during their visit to Iran, the envoy said. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

However, the relief in the present case cannot be enforced as a bench headed by Justice Sanjiv Khanna, on May 10, 2024 and July 12, 2024, had imposed these conditions and made clear that they can only be recalled or modified be a larger constitution bench. Kejriwal will have to seek modification of these restrictions by approaching the chief justice of India to set up a larger bench. The top court also imposes a slew of other conditions and directed that Kejriwal be released on bail upon furnishing bail bonds for a sum of Rs 10 lakh with two sureties of such like amount, to the satisfaction of the trial court.

The call given at Khanauri and Shambhu - the two places on Punjab-Haryana border where the farmers were camping - was \"Any party but the BJP\". The farmers did not even allow BJP candidates to enter the villages to campaign in Punjab. Pandher further said, \"We will discuss how to put forward our demands and then take a common call. Even in Punjab, the morcha did not give a call to boycott BJP or openly say that BJP candidates should not be allowed in villages.

Justice Bhuyan said Kejriwal's continued incarceration in the CBI case \"has become untenable\". In his judgement, Justice Kant ruled that \"Kejriwal's arrest does not suffer with any procedural infirmity\". Recording that the \"trial is unlikely to occur in the immediate future\", Justice Kant said that in CBI's case, 17 accused and 224 individuals have been identified as witnesses besides \"extensive documentation, physical and digital\". Holding that although the procedure for Kejriwal's \"arrest meets the requisite criteria for legality and compliance\", the judge said \"continued incarceration for an extended period pending trial would infringe\" his right to liberty.

The top court directed Kejriwal to not make any public comments on the merits of the CBI case. \"This condition is necessitated to dissuade a recent tendency of building a self-serving narrative on public platforms,\" Justice Kant held in his judgement. In his separate judgement, Justice Bhuyan expressed \"serious reservations\" on conditions imposed by another division bench in the ED case debarring Kejriwal from attending the office of the chief minister and Delhi secretariat as well as from signing files. However, \"having regard to judicial discipline, I would refrain from further expressing my views thereon at this stage since those conditions have been imposed in the separate ED case by a two-judge bench of this court\", he added. \"It is imperative that the CBI dispel the notion of it being a caged parrot,\" Justice Bhuyan said. \"In a functional democracy governed by the rule of law, perception matters. Like Caesar's wife, an investigating agency must be above board,\" he said in the judgement. CBI's perception should rather be \"that of an uncaged parrot\", Justice Bhuyan added. The CBI is the premier investigating agency of the country and it is in public interest that it must not only be above board but must also seem to be so, he said. CBI's arrest of Kejriwal \"raises more questions than it seeks to answer\", Justice Bhuyan said. Questioning the \"necessity and timing\" of the arrest, he said \"it is evident that the CBI did not feel the need and necessity to arrest\" Kejriwal for over 22 months and it was only after he got regular bail in the ED case that the agency \"activated its machinery and took the appellant into custody\". The judge said the CBI \"cannot justify arrest and continued detention citing evasive reply\". #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

Sarees well over a century old are still worn proudly by their current owners, after all. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} But the fact that those ancient Indian fibres found thousands of miles away in Israel had been dyed in natural tints of blue, purple, pink, green and black added a different dimension to the exhibited sarees. At least for those who regard sarees as not merely six yards of embellished cloth but as exemplars of India's living tradition. After all, many of the vintage sarees on display were also dyed in the same shades, probably even using the same natural colouring agents. There is a timeless sheen to older sarees, not merely because of the quality of raw materials used back then, from fine cotton and silk yarns to pure gold and silver zari threads, but also the motifs used on the body, borders and pallus. The sarees were delicately crafted, with no corners cut in terms of design and execution. They were also made to last forever, not as a measure of thrift but as tangible proof of their skill as master spinners, weavers, dyers and embroiderers. Many of today's sarees are garish by comparison, with coarser threads, mostly gaudy chemical dyes and designs that seek to bedazzle rather than charm. Price tags are no guarantee of excellence either. Look at the kantha and chikankari of today and yesteryear, the ikats of yore and now, Kanchipurams , Jamdanis , Benarasis Patans , Paithanis... Human beings are far more knowledgeable now than they were several millennia ago. There is far wider access to both education and information as well. Yet our tastes do not seem to become more refined, even though the very same brains continue to take technology to dizzying heights. Why is there an overweening preference for big, blingy and brash, be it in car design, jewellery, houses or, indeed, saree motifs among otherwise 'evolved' humans?

Instead, tons of those unmemorable garments are destined for landfills, or being virtuously recycled for equally ephemeral purposes. Sadly, when our civilisation is excavated in some distant future, these are what will be discussed threadbare in order to understand the contradictory 'material culture' of our times. What will these mass-made, synthetically coloured textiles reveal about us 21st century Indians? A people devoid of discernment? A civilisation obsessed with quantity over quality, novelty over authenticity? A culture that wilfully turned its back on time-tested older practices in the name of expediency, even after evidence emerged that not all scientific 'progress' counted as improvement and some-like chemical dyes-could be harmful for us in the long run? Excavators in the distant future may be puzzled, though, if they discover a few sarees from that Delhi Crafts Council exhibition amid the detritus of fast fashion in a mound that was once the grand city of New Delhi. Those exquisite sarees, woven just a few decades before those ersatz garments and yet somehow linked to millennia older micro-fibres found in Israel, may be our saving grace, belying uncomplimentary theories about the trajectory of our 'civilisation'! #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

Chambers, also chairman emeritus of Cisco, said the perfect storm is brewing with a rapidly accelerating India-US partnership, rapid advances in AI and steady leadership that will propel India as the world's second largest economy in three to four decades and the largest by the end of the century. \"In his first 5 years in office he laid the ground for the next five. In the next five years in office he laid the ground for the next 25 years. I think this five is about laying the framework of the century. This is India's century,\" Chambers said in an interview with ET at the sidelines of the INDUS X summit that promotes joint defence innovation. He added that the third term sends a message of predictability and safety of investments into India.

We're just getting started,\" he said, adding that the US partnership adds 2% to the Indian GDP while India can add 1% to the GDP of the largest economy in the world. Chambers said no matter who wins the upcoming Presidential elections, the India-US relationship will not see any dramatic change. Describing India as the best place to be invested in the entire world, Chambers said that his prediction is that by the end of the century, the Indian economy will be 90-100% larger than China and perhaps 30-40% bigger than the US. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",

This has encouraged more multinational companies to set up local offices and boost hiring, a trend that is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. U.S energy firm Chevron and French pharma company Sanofi recently committed around $1.4 billion cumulatively to set up or expand their GCCs. The report estimates the number of companies with GCCs in India to grow to around 2,100-2,200 by 2030, employing 2.5 million to 2.8 million people.

The growth has been driven by the scale and quality of the talent pool, given India's status as one of the oldest offshoring ecosystems globally, said Namita Adavi, partner of the India GCC Consulting Practice at Zinnov. This has \"created a flywheel effect in terms of the talent that is being churned out.\" Adavi expects the growth to come from sectors such as retail, healthcare and pharma, among others. Currently, software and internet, and the banking, financial services, and insurance segments have the biggest presence in the country. Leadership roles based in India are also expected to balloon to more than 30,000 by 2023, from the current 6,500, the report said. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;}",
