        "content": "Adobe announced the general availability of Adobe Workfront Planning. Part of Adobe Workfront, an industry-leading enterprise work management application, this new offering connects fragmented workflows and data across marketing teams, with actionable insights that allow brands to execute campaigns with greater speed. Marketers have been under increasing pressure to deliver highly personalized customer experiences, without any material increase in resources. Workfront Planning addresses this by defining and creating the ‚Äúmetadata‚Äù of work, providing full visibility into day-to-day marketing operations. This effectively creates a ‚Äúmarketing system of record‚Äù, a practice that has allowed other functions such as sales or finance to power planning and execution with data intelligence. Instead of manually gathering details across teams, Workfront Planning allows marketers to quickly answer questions such as ‚ÄúHow many campaigns are we running this year?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhich tactics are most frequently used in our campaigns?‚Äù. Users have these actionable insights right at their fingertips, surfaced through both curated visualizations and a generative AI-powered conversational interface. This can dramatically shorten the time it takes to plan and launch new campaigns, removing the labour-intensive work of aligning teams on timing and objectives. Users can also accelerate time-to-market by leveraging generative AI to summarize information, keep marketing records up-to-date or quickly set up new campaigns. ‚ÄúThe daily work of the modern marketer has become increasingly complex, as different teams charge forward on individual campaigns without much visibility into the efforts of their colleagues,‚Äù . ‚ÄúThe net result is fragmented marketing operations where too much time is spent trying to align programs and stakeholders, a problem Workfront Planning solves by providing a centralized solution to plan campaigns, deliver marketing briefs and orchestrate work across teams.‚Äù : The marketing calendar in Workfront Planning visualizes day-to-day marketing work in an easy-to-digest format. For instance, a timeline view displays all active campaigns in a chronological format that is customizable for any team or stakeholder. A user can automatically view campaigns targeting a certain audience or for a specific objective . A spreadsheet view provides a deeper look into each campaign, providing end-to-end visibility on key messages, individual contributors, project status and more. When marketers are ready to create a new campaign, generative AI-powered capabilities will soon enable users to take action on previously static plans. Marketers will be able to simply upload existing assets to create campaign records and generate a marketing brief. This curated view will include everything from marketing tactics and objectives to relevant assets and timelines. The conversational interface in Workfront Planning, powered by generative AI, also allows users to query details across campaigns, helping answer pressing questions that come up during planning stages. : Effective planning hinges on marketing records that are accurate and up-to-date. These records can include details such as target audience and region, tactics, relevant business unit and more‚Äîalso known as the ‚Äúmetadata‚Äù of marketing. With the generative-AI powered conversational interface, users can automatically create or update records as plans evolve. Marketers simply upload an asset, such as a Word document with the latest campaign details, and the record is automatically updated. Records can then be connected into a marketing graph, which visualizes the connections between teams and workflows. This produces additional insights to drive alignment and shortens the time it takes to get campaigns into market. Global brands from Deloitte and IPG Health to NASCAR have used Workfront Planning to boost productivity and meet the rising demand for highly personalized marketing campaigns. The new offering is also having an impact on the Adobe Global Marketing Organization, by enabling teams to develop coordinated plans and gain full visibility into marketing activities. üëâ",

        "content": "Adobe announced significant updates to Adobe Premiere Pro , featuring a new color management system and performance improvements, directly addressing top community requests to streamline video editing workflows. These enhancements help editors work faster and more efficiently to meet the increasing demand for both short and long-form content. Key Updates in Premiere Pro : Color Management The all-new Premiere color management combines all of this technology in a way that makes it easier to work with raw and log formats natively in Premiere Pro, so you always get a great starting point ‚Äî you‚Äôll see great-looking footage as soon as clips are dropped into the timeline ‚Äî without having to spend time adding LUTs. This automatic system normalizes raw and log media while taking advantage of all that data in the color pipeline for better control and beautiful images. An entirely new color management system that automatically transforms RAW and log footage from nearly every camera into great-looking SDR and HDR, so users can spend less time managing LUTs and start editing right away. A new wide gamut working color space that‚Äôs vastly larger than Premiere‚Äôs HD Rec.709 working space in which all image processing operations are performed. This new wide gamut color space leverages Hollywood‚Äôs industry standard ACEScct with high-fidelity tone mapping that provides the kind of color and fidelity results that were previously impossible with Premiere Pro. Six simple ‚Äúset-it-and-forget-it‚Äù presets in Sequence Settings and Lumetri color settings let users work in traditional Rec.709 for legacy projects or the new wide gamut color ACEScct with ease. Most-used effects, like Lumetri, are now color space aware with smoother and more flexible control for refining skin tones, balance, and creative looks when working in a wide-gamut preset. Consistent color and brightness when using Dynamic Link to send clips to and from Adobe After Effects for motion design and compositing Adobe is also introducing a new Properties panel that makes Premiere Pro easier to learn for beginners and makes video editing even faster for experienced professionals. With the Properties panel, editors can do things they‚Äôve never been able to do before in Premiere Pro, like crop video directly from the Program monitor, or highlight and adjust the properties of multiple clips or graphics at the same time. Consolidating the most frequently used tools in a single panel, along with the ability to directly manipulate images using on-screen controls, and the ability to batch process multiple clips at a time make this a game changer for anyone editing in Premiere Pro. It makes it easier for new users to learn the app, and more efficient for existing power users to work quickly. Adobe has been working hard at making Premiere Pro faster and more reliable for every job. With even more hardware acceleration, you‚Äôll have faster playback for codecs like AVC and HEVC. ProRes exports are now up to 3x faster so editors can deliver cuts to clients faster and get home earlier. Adobe also added format support for even more Canon, Sony, and RED cameras so users can import native files and start editing immediately. With two dark modes, a light mode, and high-contrast accessibility mode, editors can customize the look and feel of Premiere Pro. Users also get cleaner fonts and typography for better legibility and consistency with other Adobe Creative Cloud apps. That means less time spent re-learning how to use tools in different apps and more time creating. üëâ",

The smartphone has already received over 4 million pre-orders that required no deposit, as per the company‚Äôs website. According to research organization IDC, the entire global market for foldable phones, in the second quarter, was around 4 million units. \"Today we bring you a product that everyone can think of but could not make.
